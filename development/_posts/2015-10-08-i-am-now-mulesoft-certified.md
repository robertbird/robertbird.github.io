Just a quick post to mark the date. After recently completing a 4 day _[Mulesoft Anypoint Platform Essentials 3.7](https://training.mulesoft.com/instructor-led-training/anypoint-platform-essentials-37)_ training course I finally got around to taking the exam.

After scoring 91.4% in the exam [I am now officially an Associate MuleSoft Developer](AssociateMulesoftDeveloper3_7.pdf)! So expect some posts on this subject soon.
