In my last post about [choosing a test automation strategy](/test-automation/choosing-a-test-automation-strategy) I described why it is important to have a strategy. When chosing to develop your own test framework there are many choices and it can be hard to know where to start and how to get up and running. 

In this post I am going to outline a series of posts I intend to write over the coming weeks, to take you step by step through the process of creating and automating a test framework using Specflow and Selenium. 

This page will serve as a table of contents for the series, which will cover the following topics: _(disclaimer: this may change as I go)_

* Part 1: Creating a framework for our specflow and selenium tests
* Part 2: Writing our first test case
* Part 3: Running tests remotely on another server
* Part 4: Automating our test framework with TeamCity
* Part 5: Keeping our specflow code organised with page models
* Part 6: Test priority and categorisation 

I will update the list above with links as I write each part, so please check back for updates. If you have any other ideas, suggestions or questions please post in the comments below.
